# robot_behavior_trees

A package for python behavior trees integrated with ROS. Action nodes are coded as action servers and are referenced through clients.

For now, rosrun nlp.py from package for full functionality.

TODO list:
    improve nlp with if statements and action arguments
    crROS integration
    easify condition nodes
